# The Accumulator Pattern

## Objective
* Define Design Pattern
* Use a Design Pattern to solve a problem
* Identify similar problems, using the same Design Pattern to solve them

## Key Terms
* Accumulator Pattern
* Design Pattern

### What's a Design Pattern?

A Design Pattern, when we're talking about code, is _a general solution to a common problem_. This simply means "using a technique to deal with something similar you've seen before". It's how most engineers actually solve problems- they learn a Design Pattern for a common problem (like adding up all of the numbers in an array), and then they can apply that same technique to solve similar problems (like squaring all the numbers in an array), where the problem is _similar_ but not necessarily the exact same.

If you've never programmed before, this is probably the very first Design Pattern you've ever been exposed to. Take a moment to review the exercises in this unit before you move on to reading about the chapter. A key part of learning a design pattern is _having a few problems to imagine applying it to_, so go check out what you're going to be asked to do before you start this unit.

Once you've reviewed the exercises, get started with the content.
