# Bonus: Studying & Learning

Flashcards are an effective learning drill that aids in the memorization of new concepts. If you like the idea of making flashcards but don't want to carry them around, **Flashcard Hero** is a free flashcard app for macOS and iOS. It supports building cards with both text and images, grouping cards by topics, testing your memory with the [Leitner system][leitner-system] of spaced repetition, and generating progress reports on how well you remember each card.
