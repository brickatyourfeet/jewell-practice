# Studying & Learning Solutions

## How to Study Effectively

##### What is the Corson technique?

The Corson technique (named after former Cornell University president Dale Corson) encourages you to pause before asking an instructor for help and ask yourself, "What is it that I don't understand?" Pick apart the problem one piece at a time and pinpoint the exact part that you don't understand and avoid just going to your instructor and saying, "I don't get it!" This practice helps you find the source of your confusion which will help immensely with all your learning going forward.

##### What is spaced repetition?

Spaced repetition is a technique to help you learn facts quickly by studying things at intervals of increasingly larger amounts of time. It takes advantage of the way your brain works by reviewing the facts you don't know more frequently and spacing out the review of facts you know well. It is found to work better than traditional linear flashcard methods and some people use SRS (spaced repetition software) to assist in applying the practice.

##### What is the method of loci?

The method of loci is a memorization technique that dates back to ancient Greek and Roman times. The idea is to associate different sets of things you're trying to learn with different rooms in a house. It takes advantage of your brain's spatial memory capabilities.

##### Explain akrasia and picoeconomics.

Akrasia is the lack of command over yourself causing you to act against your better judgement. The concept is attributed to Plato. Picoeconomics refers to the hyperbolic discounting that we do downplaying the value of a task the more it is delayed and the reward is pushed off into the future. We procrastinate and do sort of fun things that don't really align with our values in the short term and we avoid doing things that really do line up with our values because of the delayed reward. You avoid akrasia by using a commitment device or adding a short-term reward like allowing yourself to watch an episode of your favorite show after you study.

##### What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short five minute breaks. You should experiment with different intervals to find out what works best for you. For example, you can try working for 45 minutes with a 15 minute break. Also, try writing down any distractions while you're working. If it's a task, you can remember to take care of it during your next break and if it's simply a distraction you can track those things and take steps to prevent them. Try blocking certain websites, turning off notifications, or putting your phone on silent.

##### Explain focused and diffused thinking.

Focused thinking takes advantage of your brain's prefrontal cortex to focus on one specific set of data. It is a great tool for processes you've gone through before and problems you already understand. When learning something new, you want to use diffused thinking which allows you to associate new information to other things already in your brain. Those connections make learning faster and more effective, even if the connection is unrelated to the new concept you are learning.  

##### If a lecture is moving too fast for you, what are some methods to help you keep up?

When possible, try going over the material before class to prime your brain. Also, make sure you ask questions when there's something you don't understand. The instructor is there to help you learn, so take advantage of that.

##### Is it better to start working on assignments alone or with a group? Why?

It is better to start an assignment by yourself. If you start by working in a group, you lose the opportunity to pinpoint gaps in your understanding, identify exactly what is causing the confusion, and shore it up. In a group setting, you tend to latch on to someone else's answer, assume you understand it, and then move on.  

## Study Less Study Smart

##### What are the benefits of breaking your studying into sessions?

The average student can only pay attention for about 25-30 minutes at a time. After that, your efficiency starts to taper off and simply studying more won't work. This is true for lectures, reading, or studying. Make sure you take regular five minute breaks where you do something fun or at least step away from studying. When you're done studying at the end of the day, reward yourself. By doing this, you train yourself to study and you'll be able to focus longer each session.

##### Why is it important to create a dedicated study area?

Your environment largely determines your behavior. If you're trying to study in a space where you normally sleep, play video games, or hangout with your friends, it will be really hard to study effectively. Find an area specifically set aside for studying so the context of the situation makes it easy for you to get into your studies.

##### What does it mean to "study actively"?

You study actively by putting concepts into your own words and then testing yourself on them. Start by determining whether you are studying a fact or a concept. A fact is something you can simply memorize (and tends to drift out of your head after time) while a concept is something you have to understand (and tends to stay with you longer).

##### What is the difference between recollection and recognition?

The human brain is really good at recognition (for example, you can recognize a face you haven't seen in a long time) but it requires a trigger. When studying, it is best to strengthen your recollection abilities by quizzing yourself rather than just looking over a list of terms. If you study by just highlighting words in a text and then reading back through them you'll tend to assume you know them when you see them and just move on.   

##### How can you take more effective notes?

As soon as class ends, flesh out your notes with more details while it's fresh in your mind. If there is something you don't have a good grasp on and didn't take enough notes on, ask a classmate or an instructor.

##### Why should you take the time to teach someone else what you learn?

The best way to learn something is to teach it. It's a great form of active studying because you're forcing your brain to recall the concepts so you can teach someone else. You are also able to quickly pinpoint areas where your knowledge might be a little shaky.

##### What is the SQ3R method?

SQ3R is a reading comprehension method named for its five steps: survey, question, read, recite, and review.

- Glance through the chapter or article in order to identify headings, sub-headings and other outstanding features in the text.
- Formulate questions about the content of the reading.
- Begin reading actively in order to answer the questions previously raised.
- In your own words, identify major points either in written form or orally.
- Create a study sheet and test yourself by attempting to recall key phrases.

##### Why is it helpful to use mnemonics when studying facts?

Facts, unlike concepts, are harder to tie meaning to. Instead of turning to basic rote memorization, it is better to use a mnemonic device. A mnemonic device is a pattern of letters, ideas, or associations that assists in remembering something. Specifically, try utilizing acronyms, coined sayings, or image associations.

## How to Take Notes in Class

##### What is the outline method?

The outline method is a note-taking system based on bullet points and hierarchy and is the most traditional method. You start by creating headers for the main topics of the lecture/chapter/article and then create subheaders, bullet points under those subheaders, etc. If you're using the outline method, it is easier to go back and fill in details if you're taking notes on a computer.

##### What is the Cornell method?

The Cornell method is a note-taking system devised in the 1950s by Walter Pauk. You start by dividing your paper into three distinct sections: a cue column, a note taking column, and a summary section. Use the note-taking section to take notes during class. As soon as possible after class, write questions in the cue column to be used when you study and quiz yourself. Use the summary section to create a brief summary of the lecture.

##### What is the mind map method?

The mind map method is a note-taking/brainstorming system that links and groups concepts together through natural associations. Start by drawing a circle in the middle of the paper and write the main topic of the lecture in it. Then draw lines out from the center for subtopics. Each of those subtopic branches can have subsequent branches of their own, and so on.

##### What is the flow method?

The flow method is a note-taking system invented by Scott Young. It is based on the concept of holistic learning which encourages students to create webs of information that link together. The goal is to create a physical document that represents your mental understanding of the subject by writing brief descriptions of key concepts and drawing arrows to create associations. You can always go back and add details to a previous point. It's a messier form of note taking and is considered the opposite of more rigid note-taking systems. The purpose of the method is to accelerate your learning by helping you to learn while you're sitting in a lecture rather than simply transcribing the lecture.

##### What is the write on the slides method?

This method is only an option if you are able to print off the lecture materials. If so, you can bring them with you to class and take notes directly on them. The strengths of this method are that you don't have to write as much and you get a timeline view of your notes over the course of the lecture.

## How to Study and Do Homework in a Time Crunch

##### How can you select the best location when studying in a time crunch?

Be sure to choose a location based on what's going on around you and what motivates you to study. Many people benefit from putting themselves in an environment where the people around them are also working. Most importantly, if you're working late at night, get as far away from your bed as possible. Make it so it would take more effort to go to bed than just finish your project or studies.

##### Explain the impact/effort matrix.

The impact/effort matrix is a framework to help you prioritize your work. Before you start, look at your workload and break it down into individual components. Then assess those components to determine which ones deserve the bulk of your attention. Avoid things that are high effort but low impact and focus on the things that will have a high impact.

##### What is ego depletion and how can you use it to your benefit?

Ego depletion is a concept pioneered by American social psychologist Roy Baumeister. He describes it by saying, "an effort of will or self-control is tiring; if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around." With this in mind, use the bulk of your effort and start by tackling high impact/high effort components first. Then you'll be able to tackle the high impact/low effort components even if you're feeling drained.

## How to Take Faster Notes

##### What are the pros and cons of using shorthand writing systems like Pitman or Gregg?

Using these systems, you could potentially write more than two hundred words per minute. But both of these systems are incredibly difficult to learn and most people don't have the time to dedicate to learning them.

##### What are the pros and cons of using writing systems like speedwriting, personal shorthand, or the Ford improved shorthand alphabet?

These systems take far less time to learn over the Pitman and Gregg shorthand systems. Your note-taking speed will certainly increase, but you won't be able to write as fast as you could with systems like Pitman or Gregg.

##### What are the main elements to consider if you decide to create your own shorthand system?

Look at commonly used prefixes and suffixes, as well as common function words that don't carry a lot of the meaning of the sentence with them (and, but, with, or, etc.). Identify strategies that are easy to remember and take fewer strokes. You can also write less by incorporating more diagrams and arrows connecting concepts into your own writing system.

## Should You Take Notes on Paper or on a Computer?

##### What are the pros of taking notes on computer?

In most cases, taking notes on a computer is faster. You can also easily reformat your notes and add additional information after the fact. You can also easily sync them to different devices so you can study your notes anytime, anywhere.

##### What are the pros of taking notes on a paper?

Notes on paper give you a lot of flexibility. For example, you can more easily draw arrows and diagrams connecting concepts. Studies have found that students who take notes on paper take fewer notes than students using a computer, but their ability to recall the material half an hour later was greater.

##### What is the difference between syntax and meaning in the context of learning something new?

The syntax is just the words you read or hear. The meaning is the context and the connection your brain makes to other concepts you already understand. If you use a computer for taking notes, be deliberate about learning the concepts as they're being presented. Don't use up so much of your brain power just recording what is being said. The goal is to avoid creating additional (and unnecessary) study time for yourself after class.

## How to Study Effectively with Flash Cards

##### What is active recall?

Active recall is the process of actively retrieving memories out of your brain. It is one of the most efficient learning strategies. Flash cards are an incredibly powerful learning tool because they promote active recall.

##### What are the benefits of making your own flash cards?

Making your own flash cards forces you to take in new information and restate it in your own words, which is a critical step in the learning process. It helps to build your neural pathways. If you use one of the many digital tools to download someone else's flash cards you're denying yourself that entire part of the learning process.

##### Explain the picture superiority effect.

The picture superiority effect refers to the fact that pictures and images are more likely to be remembered than words. This is true because our brains are adapted to be very sensitive to imagery. Additionally, descriptive sentences next to images make them even easier to recall.

##### How can you use mnemonic devices and associative imagery to improve your flash cards?

A mnemonic device is anything that helps you create a mental association between two pieces of information. Associative imagery allows you to use photographs or images to trigger responses when explaining concepts. Since most likely you are the only one who will use your flash cards, it only matters that they make sense to you. Any image or association (no matter how outrageous) should be used as long as it helps you to remember the concepts.

##### How can you prevent illusions of competence?

Illusions of competence occur when our brains confuse recognition with recall. Recognition is just affirming that you've seen something before while recall is the active process of retrieving something out of your memory. The best way to prevent this from happening is to break down complex concepts into multiple simple questions.

##### Why is it helpful to say your answers out loud?

When saying your answers out loud, you have to mentally commit to your answer before looking at the other side of the card. This helps avoid confusing recognition with recall.

##### Why is it helpful to study your flash cards from both sides?

By studying from both sides of the card, you solidify the neural pathways and concepts in your brain. It helps you to recall the information in more cases.

##### Why shouldn't flash cards be considered a silver bullet?

Flash cards are only one method for reviewing material and they are situational. Flash cards are good when reviewing something you've already learned, but not when learning new concepts. Flash cards generally don't give context to facts which is a more effective way to learn.  

## The Most Powerful Way to Remember What You Study

##### Explain the spacing effect.

Our brains make better connections and overall remember things more effectively when we space out our learning over time. Spacing out work involving higher mental functions allows neural connections to solidify.

##### Why does the spacing effect work?

One of the most important parts of the learning process is forgetting. The harder we have to work to retrieve something from our brain, the greater the increase in learning will be. Without a little forgetting, you get no benefit from further study.

##### How would you use spaced repetition with other study methods?

Spaced repetition is so powerful because you can pair it with almost any study technique; it's complementary. It's all about modifying the time periods of study, but you can use any study method you prefer during those times.

##### What is the Leitner system?

The Leitner system is a method for efficiently using flash cards by sorting them into groups according to how well you know each one. If you successfully recall the answer on the flash card, you move the card to the next group which represents a longer period of time before you will revisit that card. If you fail to recall the answer, move the card all the way back to the first group. This method helps you study more efficiently by forcing you to spend more time on cards that need more review.

##### List some apps that can be used to build flash cards

Anki, Tinycards, Flashcards Deluxe, Memrise, SuperMemo, Mnemosyne, Eidetic, and Quizlet.

## 5 Tips for Dealing with Lazy Group Project Members

##### What are some things you can do at the start of a group project to avoid communication issues?

When you first meet to discuss the project divide up the work to be done and assign specific tasks to each group member. Have everyone verbally confirm what they are going to do and get contact information for each group member.

##### What are some online tools you can use to communicate/coordinate as a group?

Trello, Asana, Basecamp, and Google docs.

##### Why is it helpful to create mini-deadlines?

Creating mini-deadlines (or milestones) helps to keep the project's work on track. It helps to identify problems early on as opposed to waiting until the night before something is due. Build in checkpoints for group members to submit work and consider appointing a project manager to collect and edit the work.

##### When and how should you involve an instructor when dealing with a lazy group member?

Once you've established that the issue is not because of bad communication or bad tools, then consider reaching out to an instructor about the problem. Remember that your instructor is trying to simulate what it will be like to work in the real world so be sure to first send a message to the group member and discuss the issue with them face to face first. But don't wait until the last minute to involve the instructor either.

##### Under what circumstances should you consider just completing the work on your own?

Once you've tried everything else that you can think of, it might be easiest to just complete the work and let the other person ride your coattails. It's obviously not the ideal scenario but it might be good training for the real world. You will always encounter people who don't communicate well, who procrastinate, or who just don't pull their weight.

## How to Overcome Perfectionism (and the Anxiety it Causes)

##### Explain the difference between adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism.

Adaptive perfectionism is considered a normal, healthy type of perfectionism that allows you to derive satisfaction from your achievements by tolerating imperfections. Adaptive perfectionists are motivated by their high standards but they aren't hyper critical of their work. Maladaptive perfectionists feel constant pressure to meet unrealistic standards and tend to resort to the harsh self-criticism.

##### What are the main problems with perfectionism?

Tasks can seem monumental when you expect the outcome to be perfect so you tend to procrastinate more. Constant tweaking can make a task take too long and eventually you may just move on without finishing anything. If you don't allow yourself to make mistakes, your skills development suffers. Holding your work to an impossible standard creates unnecessary anxiety and stress.

##### Why is it helpful to realize that no one is perfect?

We see people producing impressive work all the time, but we only see the final product. We don't see the work that went into someone's final product or the mistakes they made along the way. It's important to embrace mistakes knowing they have to happen in order for you to get better.

##### How can you reduce the stress associated with starting a new project?

Just get started and don't worry about making a mess. Don't stress over the state of the project the first time through because you're the only one who will see it at that point. Then go back through and get it ready to share with others who can provide constructive feedback.

##### How can setting a deadline help you manage perfectionism?

If you hold your work to an impossible standard and refuse to complete projects and put them out into the world, you'll never improve. Setting a deadline or a goal to complete a certain number of projects by a certain date can help you overcome that. Be sure to show off your work even when you don't think it's complete. It is important to create a structure that prevents you from focusing on the minutiae of one project for too long.

##### Why should you be satisfied with small improvements in your work?

Even if you are only improving a tiny bit each time you do something, that progress over time will lead to mastery of a task. Skill and knowledge come through countless iteration, not through executing perfectly on the first iteration.

##### Why is it counterintuitive to compare your work to the work of others?

It makes no sense to compare your work as a beginner against the work of someone who has been doing something for a lot longer. You should certainly let others influence, inspire, and motivate you but the only thing you should measure your work against is your previous work.

## Can Music Help You Study More Effectively?

##### What kinds of tasks are generally okay to pair with high energy or high intensity music?

Tasks that require low mental effort or tasks dealing with very tangible material with which you are already familiar.

##### When is it generally not a good idea to listen to high intensity music or music with lyrics while studying?

High intensity music or music with lyrics could very likely have a problematic effect when you're using the language processing parts of your brain or trying to wrap your brain around something that is totally unfamiliar to you.

##### What are some of the potential positive effects of listening to music while studying?

Listening to music has the potential to raise your positive emotions, lessen your anxiety, and raise your motivation to stay focused.  

## Brain-Enhancing Music and Binaural Beats: Do They Work?

##### What is a binaural beat?

A binaural beat is an auditory illusion perceived when you hear two different tones played through each ear. The listener perceives a fast oscillation between the two tones. A lot of neural activity is rhythmic and studies have found ways to create an external stimulus that can influence the frequency of brain waves.

##### What is the scientific consensus on whether you can design audio to cause specific beneficial changes in the brain?

It is unclear.
