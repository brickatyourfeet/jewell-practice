## JavaScript

**Duration:** About 15 hours

**JavaScript** is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language that's primarily used to change how a website looks and behaves when a user interacts with it. For this reason, JavaScript is an essential technology for web developers and, therefore, the central focus of our in-person training.


Our Pre-Course is a series of articles about programming with JavaScript, and JavaScript programming challenges to solve simple problems that will take you through the basic syntax of JavaScript. This course is designed to be used by someone without any prior experience with JavaScript or any other programming language, so it's a great jumping off point. By the end of the course, you should be able to pass our Technical Admissions Interview, so long as you keep a growth mindset and take every practice opportunity you can!


### Conclusion

Congratulations! By completing the assessment, you've demonstrated a high degree of discipline and familiarity with JavaScript. Take a moment to congratulate yourself for all of your hard work. :)
