## JavaScript

**Duration:** About 15 hours

**JavaScript** is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies for full stack web developers. The majority of websites employ JavaScript code as it's supported by all modern web browsers.

In this chapter, your objective is to demonstrate familiarity with JavaScript. To complete this objective, please read the book **JavaScript for Kids** through chapter 8 and then complete the assessment at the end of this chapter. While the title may suggest otherwise, this book is for anyone who wants to learn JavaScript or to start programming for the first time. It's designed to be kid friendly, but it can serve as a programming book for beginners of all ages. In the spirit of the "Dummies" books and "Idiot's Guide" books, JavaScript for Kids approach the topic of writing JavaScript as if the reader has little to no background in it.

You can pick up JavaScript for Kids from a number of places, though you'll receive a **40% discount** by using the `JAVASCRIPTKIDS40` coupon code when purchasing through No Starch Press' online store.
