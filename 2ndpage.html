    <h1>Booya</h1>
    <p>I had enjoyed working in tech before and had been unhappy with my career path in small business. So I heard about bootcamps and started delving into things.
      (Right after reading "Ready Player One") and it turned out I really enjoyed it. I am super excited to learn all this stuff and to have a career as a developer.</p>
