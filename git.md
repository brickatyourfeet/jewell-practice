## STRETCH: Git and Github

**Duration:** About 1.5 Hours

### Git

In the most simplistic of terms, Git manages different [versions of files](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control). Git does this amazingly well, and it's the reason why [most web-based companies use Git](http://git-scm.com/#companies-projects) to manage their codebases. We will use Git just about every day and you will likely use it as often at work.

You should have git already installed. Open your terminal and type in `git`. The terminal should either list a bunch of git commands or prompt you to install git. If for some reason that doesn't happen, try [installing git manually](http://git-scm.com/download/mac).

To learn Git, we're going to sign-up for two websites that have a number of free modules on how to code. We'll also read through a tutorial that discusses some of the basics of Git.

---
##### Do this:
1. Sign-up for an account on [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com).

1. Complete [Code School's Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

1. Sign-up for an account on [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com).

1. Complete [Code Academy's Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git).

1. Read [Atlassian's Getting Started](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository) (in particular the `git init` and `git config` sections).

1. Go into the `prework` folder you created in the previous step and create a new folder called `git-practice`.

1. Go into that folder and initialize git.

1. Create a new file with any name.

1. Add the file to the staging area.

1. Commit the file with a commit message! (e.g. 'I am adding files to git!')

1. With a git command, log your commit history and save that to a file called 'log.txt'.
  * Hint: Use one of the new commands you learned above to do this.

### Git with Github
Git repositories can be stored online using Github, an extremely popular hosting service. Git and Github are _different_. `git` is a program you run on your machine while Github is a website that stores those repositories. Repositories live on your machine and on Github. The primary goal of Github is to make collaboration with other developers easy.

You should have already created a Github account to get access to the prework.

1. Generate an [SSH Key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/). You'll use this for connecting to Github.

1. Create a [Github Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/). Call it `git-practice`.

1. Follow the instructions on screen to push up your local repository to Github (you can skip the part about the README file).

1. Read more about the [Pull-Request Workflow](https://github.com/asmeurer/git-workflow).
