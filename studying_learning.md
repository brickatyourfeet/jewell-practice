**Duration:** About 2.5 hours

For many incoming students, their studying and learning techniques are a bit rusty. Maybe it's been a while since they've been in school or maybe they just never had anyone to show them good techniques. The **Effective Studying and Learning** video series will help you develop academic skills used by highly successful students. With some practice, your ability to retain and apply complex, web development concepts will drastically improve.
