# CSS

**Duration:** About 7 hours

Cascading Style Sheets, or **CSS**, is a language for describing the style of a web page with syntax like `p { color: orange; }`. Together, HTML and CSS are two essential technologies for web development.

In this chapter, your objective is to demonstrate competency with CSS. To complete this objective, please follow along with the tutorial found below and complete the assessment at the end of this chapter. If you're already familiar with CSS, you may be able to complete the assessment without reading the tutorial. Though, you may also learn a trick or two from it.

As you read through the tutorial, type out every code sample by hand that you come across. Then try to run the code in a web browser like Google Chrome. Only copy-and-paste code as a last resort if you can't get it to work correctly.

## Objectives

1. [Use CSS to add style to a web-page](#CSS)
2. [Use CSS to change the position of content on a web-page](#Floats)
3. [Push your work to Github](#Push-to-Github)

### CSS

CSS uses HTML tags and attributes to style a web-page. The number of styles and the combination of their uses is both impressive and overwhelming. To give you a brief introduction to the basics of CSS, please complete [Lesson 3: Getting to know CSS][11]. To gain some interactive experience with CSS, please try [CSS Diner][12].

With this knowledge of CSS, apply alternating color to the rows of movies in your result's page of IMDB.

### Floats

Changing the position of content on a web-page is common task. In order to create an accurate layout of the result's page of IMDB, you'll need to learn how to do this. To help you achieve this goal, please complete [Lesson 5: Positioning Content][21].

After you complete this lesson, add the appropriate CSS to create two columns for your result's page.

- Column 1
  - Titles
  - Names
  - Keywords
  - Companies
