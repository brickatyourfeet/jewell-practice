## Personal Site

**Duration:** About 7 hours

Your task is to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build a personal website for yourself. You'll find some guidelines below on the how to approach the project. If time permits, you'll have an opportunity to present your website to your peers during the course. Think of it as a fun and creative way of getting to know one another.

#### Scope and Content

Your personal website should have two pages linked together with anchor tags.

On the first page, describe who you are and where you come from. Tell us about yourself, your hobbies, hometown, family, friends, etc. For example:

> Hi there! My name is Zelda. I was born into royalty and spend my nights and weekends battling evil. My closest friend is Link. Together, we protect the kingdom of Hyrule. Here's a picture of us fighting Ganon. [INSERT PHOTO]

On the second page, describe where you're going in life and who you'll become. Tell us about your career goals, education goals, hopes, dreams, etc. For example:

> I'm excited to start Galvanize and learn about web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enrolled in the web development immersive because I've always been fascinated by the web's ability to bring people together. After Galvanize, I would love to work for a social network company like Snapchat or OKCupid.

#### Structure

When it comes to structure, use semantic tags for your content.

- If you have content that's a primary heading, use an `<h1>` tag.
- If you have content that's a secondary heading, use an `<h2>` tag.
- If you have content that's an ordered list, use an `<ol>` tag.
- If you have content that's an unordered list, use an `<ul>` tag.
- If you have content that's tabular, use a `<table>` tag.
- If you have content that's belongs in the same section, use a `<section>` tag.
- If you have content that's belongs in the same navigation, use a `<nav>` tag.
- And so on.

##### GIF
Somewhere on your website, include an animated GIF that illustrates how you feel about starting your new career. For example:

#### Style

You're free to style your website in any way you please. Though it may feel intimidating, this is your chance to show us who you are.

Take this opportunity to present your personality to us visually. The design you come up with should represent your personality. Colors, borders, layout, fonts, sizes, etc. is up to you!

- Capture our attention with typographic properties like `font`, `line-height`, and `text-align`.
- Arrange your content with layout properties like `display`, `position`, `left`, `top`, `float`, and `clear`.
- Size your content with dimensional properties like `height`, `width`, `padding`, `border`, and `margin`.
- Spice up to your content with coloration properties like `color`, `background-color`, and `background-image`.
- And so on.

You're free to get as fancy as you want, but don't feel like you have to go overboard.

##### Custom CSS
The site should include an external, linked stylesheet with custom CSS.

Note that the CSS should be linked to from a separate CSS file. For more information on how to do this, refer to [this article on the subject](http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/adding-css-to-html-with-link-embed-inline-and-import).

#### Interactivity

The site should use jQuery to make it interactive.

##### jQuery

Use jQuery to change something on the page when a user clicks a button. The button can do _anything_, but it must be handled using jQuery.

#### Valid Syntax

To help you write correct code, we recommend you use a **syntax validator**â€”a tool that'll list out all the syntax warnings and errors in your code. It's okay if your code has syntax warnings, but you'll want to fix any syntax errors before you submit your website. The syntax validators check one file at a time, so remember to validate each HTML and CSS file.

- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload)

### Submit Your Website
